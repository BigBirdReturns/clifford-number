# The Clifford Number

The Clifford Number is a surface-hop topology compiler. It maps how bounded legitimate surfaces carry actors, companies, policy machinery, advisory roles, capital, and outcomes through plausible-deniability corridors.

This release abandons the generic shortest-path edge graph. The old graph is preserved under `legacy/`, but it is no longer the product.

## Core rule

A Clifford Number path may only move from Actor to Actor through a shared bounded Surface.

A broad institution is not a hop. No. 10, Cabinet Office, DSIT, ARIA, News UK, Faculty, and Electric Twin can appear as venues or organizations, but they do not create Clifford Number hops by themselves. A named bounded surface inside them can.

## Source ledgers

```text
data/ledger/claims.jsonl
data/ledger/surfaces.jsonl
data/ledger/participation.jsonl
data/ledger/receipts.jsonl
```

Claims preserve sourced facts. Surfaces define bounded adjacency objects. Participation rows link actors and organizations to surfaces. Receipts preserve source support.

## Canonical registries

```text
data/canonical/actors.json
data/canonical/organizations.json
data/canonical/aliases.json
data/canonical/predicates.json
data/canonical/surface-types.json
```

Canonical files control identities and vocabularies. Do not solve ambiguity in generated artifacts.

## Generated artifacts

```text
build/receipt-graph.json
build/surface-graph.json
build/hop-graph.json
build/scores.json
build/migration-review.md
build/scout-report.md
```

Generated artifacts are disposable. Do not edit them by hand.

## Commands

```bash
npm run compile
npm run validate:release
npm run scout
npm run release:check
npm run serve
```

`npm run release:check` compiles the master doc, builds the hop graph, scores actors and organizations, runs the scout, validates release invariants, and runs the compiler tests.

## Regression fixtures

This release must pass five fixtures before the full database can be trusted:

1. Ben Warner produces government, employment/investment, campaign, founder/officer, customer/vendor, and category-formation surfaces.
2. Electric Twin behaves as a surface factory, not as a generic organization node.
3. Simon Case is represented through governance continuity surfaces.
4. Surface types distinguish hop-eligible, non-hop scorable, context-only, and scout-only surfaces.
5. Broad institutions never create Clifford Number hops.
